# Number Systems

A numeral system (or system of numeration) is a writing system for expressing numbers; that is, a mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set, using digits (Links to an external site.) or other symbols in a consistent manner. The same sequence of symbols may represent different numbers in different numeral systems. For example, "11" represents the number three in the binary numeral system (used in computers) and the number eleven in the decimal numeral system (used in common life). - Reference: Numeral System
